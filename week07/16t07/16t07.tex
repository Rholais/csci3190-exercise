	\frametitle{Number of Comparisons}
	\onslide<1->\begin{crl}\label{c-11-2-1}
		The number of comparisons used by a sorting algorithm to sort $n$ elements based on binary comparisons is $\Omega(n \log n)$.
	\end{crl}
	\onslide<2->\begin{proof}
		We can use Theorem \ref{t-11-2-1} to provide a big-Omega estimate for the number of comparisons used by a sorting algorithm based on binary comparison. We need only note that $\lceil \log n! \rceil$ is $\Theta(n \log n)$.
	\end{proof}
	
	\onslide<3>A consequence of Corollary \ref{c-11-2-1} is that a sorting algorithm based on binary comparisons that
	uses $\Theta(n \log n)$ comparisons, in the worst case, to sort $n$ elements is optimal, in the sense that no other such algorithm has better worst-case complexity. Note that we see that the merge sort algorithm is optimal in this sense.

	\frametitle{Average Number of Comparisons}
	\onslide<1->\begin{theorem}
		The average number of comparisons used by a sorting algorithm to sort $n$ elements based on binary comparisons is $\Omega(n \log n)$.
	\end{theorem}
	\onslide<2>\begin{proof}
		The average number of comparisons used by a sorting algorithm based on binary comparisons is the average depth of a leaf in the decision tree representing the sorting algorithm. We know that the average depth of a leaf in a binary tree with $N$ vertices
		is $\Omega(\log N)$. We obtain the following estimate when we let $N = n!$ and note that a function that is $\Omega(\log n!)$ is also $\Omega(n \log n)$ because $\log n!$ is $\Omega (n \log n)$.
	\end{proof}

\frametitle{Function}
Consider the set $X$ of all functions $f \colon A \rightarrow B$, where $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$, $B = \{a, b, c, d, e\}$.\begin{enumerate}
	\item How many functions are there in $X$?
	\item How many functions in $X$ are one-to-one? Give one example if there is at least one.
	\item How many functions in $X$ are onto? Give one example if there is at least one.
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Solution} \begin{enumerate}
	\item $5^7$.
	\item $0$, because $|A| > |B|$.
	\item There are 2 kinds of situations, 1 of them is that 1 of $B$ matches 3 of $A$ and others match 1 of $A$ for each, the other 1 is that 2 of $B$ match 2 of $A$ for each and others match 1 of $A$ for each. We will discuss these 2 situations separately.
	
	For the first situation, we select 1 of 5 in $B$ and then for each of other 4 items in $B$ select 1 different item in $A$ so that there are ${}_5 C_1 \times {}_7 P_4$ functions in the first situation.
	
	For the second situation, we select 2 of 5 in $B$, for each of other 3 items in $B$ select 1 different item in $A$ and then from the rest 4 items in $A$ select 2 of them to match 1 of 2 rest item in $B$ so that there are ${}_5 C_2 \times {}_7 P_3 \times {}_4 C_2$ functions in the section situation.
	
	Totally, there are ${}_5 C_1 \times {}_7 P_4 + {}_5 C_2 \times {}_7 P_3 \times {}_4 C_2 = 16800$ functions.
	
	\item One of the onto functions is: $\{(1, a), (2, b), (3, c), (4, d), (5, e), (6, a), (7, b)\}$.
\end{enumerate}

\frametitle{Generating Function}
\onslide<1->Let the lifespan of a raccoon be exactly 6 years. Suppose there are 4 new-born raccoons at the 0th year and the number of new-born raccoons in each year is 3 times that in the previous year. Let $b_r$ be the number of raccoons on year $r$ where $r \ge 0$. Give a closed form generating function for $b_r$.

\onslide<2>\textbf{Solution} Number of newborns is \begin{equation}
n_r = \begin{cases}
4 \times 3^r, & r \ge 0\\
0, & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases} \leftrightarrow \frac{4}{1 - 3x},
\end{equation} so that number of racoons is \begin{equation}
b_r = \Sigma_{i = r - 5}^{r} n_i \leftrightarrow \frac{4(1 - x^6)}{(1 - 3x)(1 - x)}.
\end{equation}
