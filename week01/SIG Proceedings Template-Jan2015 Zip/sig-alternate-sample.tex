% This is "sig-alternate.tex" V2.1 April 2013
% This file should be compiled with V2.5 of "sig-alternate.cls" May 2012
%
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V2.5 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which

% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.

\section{Propositional Logic}
\subsection{Propositional Logic}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Explain, without using a truth table, why $(p \vee q \vee r) \wedge
(\neg p \vee \neg q \vee \neg r)$ is true when at least one of $p$, $q$, and $r$
is true and at least one is false, but is false when all three
variables have the same truth value.

\item Let $p$, $q$, and $r$ be the propositions

$p$ : Grizzly bears have been seen in the area.

$q$ : Hiking is safe on the trail.

$r$ : Berries are ripe along the trail.

Write these propositions using p, q, and r and logical
connectives (including negations).
\begin{enumerate}
\item Berries are ripe along the trail, but grizzly bears have
not been seen in the area.
\item Grizzly bears have not been seen in the area and hiking
on the trail is safe, but berries are ripe along the
trail.
\item If berries are ripe along the trail, hiking is safe if and
only if grizzly bears have not been seen in the area.
\item It is not safe to hike on the trail, but grizzly bears have
not been seen in the area and the berries along the trail
are ripe.
\item For hiking on the trail to be safe, it is necessary but not
sufficient that berries not be ripe along the trail and
for grizzly bears not to have been seen in the area.
\item Hiking is not safe on the trail whenever grizzly bears
have been seen in the area and berries are ripe along
the trail.
\end{enumerate}
\item Let $p$, $q$, and $r$ be the propositions

$p$ :You have the flu.

$q$ :You miss the final examination.

$r$ :You pass the course.

Express each of these propositions as an English sentence.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $p\rightarrow q$
	\item $\neg q \leftrightarrow r$
	\item $q \rightarrow \neg r$
	\item $p \vee q \vee r$
	\item $(p \rightarrow \neg r ) \vee (q \rightarrow \neg r)$
	\item $(p\wedge q)\vee (\neg q \wedge r)$
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Application}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Each inhabitant of a remote village always tells the truth
or always lies.A villager will give only a \textquotedblleft Yes\textquotedblright or a \textquotedblleft No\textquotedblright
response to a question a tourist asks. Suppose you are a
tourist visiting this area and come to a fork in the road.
One branch leads to the ruins you want to visit; the other
branch leads deep into the jungle. A villager is standing
at the fork in the road. What one question can you ask the
villager to determine which branch to take?

\item To use the wireless network in the airport you must pay
the daily fee unless you are a subscriber to the service.
Express your answer in terms of $w$: "You can use the wireless
network in the airport," $d$: "You pay the daily fee,"
and $s$: "You are a subscriber to the service."

Exercises $3 - 7$ relate to inhabitants of the island of knights
and knaves created by Smullyan, where knights always tell
the truth and knaves always lie. You encounter two people,
A and B. Determine, if possible, what A and B are if they
address you in the ways described. If you cannot determine
what these two people are, can you draw any conclusions?
\item A says "At least one of us is a knave" and B says nothing.
\item A says "The two of us are both knights" and B says "A
is a knave."
\item A says "I am a knave or B is a knight" and B says nothing.
\item Both A and B say "I am a knight."
\item A says "We are both knaves" and B says nothing.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Propositional Equivalences}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that $(p \wedge q) \rightarrow p$ is a tautology
by using truth tables.

\item Determine whether $(\neg q \wedge (p \rightarrow q)) \rightarrow \neg p$ is a tautology.

\item Show that $(p \vee q) \wedge (\neg p \vee r) \rightarrow (q \vee r)$ is a tautology.

\item Show that $(\neg(p \vee F) \wedge (\neg q \wedge T)) \vee p$ and $q\rightarrow p$ are equivalent.

\item Show that $((\neg p) \rightarrow (r\vee q)) \equiv ((\neg r)\rightarrow ((\neg p)\rightarrow q))$.

\item Show that $(p \rightarrow (r \rightarrow q))\equiv (p \rightarrow q)\vee \neg r$.

\subsection{Propositional Logic}
\subsubsection{Propositional Logic}
\begin{enumerate}

\item The first clause is true if and only if at least one of $p$, $q$, and
$r$ is true. The second clause is true if and only if at least one of
the three variables is false. Therefore the entire statement is
true if and only if there is at least one T and one F among the
truth values of the variables, in other words, that they don’t all
have the same truth value.
\item
\begin{enumerate}
\item $r \wedge \neg  p$
\item $\neg p \wedge q\wedge r$
\item $r \rightarrow (q \leftrightarrow \neg p) $
\item $\neg q \wedge \neg p \wedge r$
\item $(q \rightarrow (\neg r\wedge \neg p))\wedge \neg((\neg r \wedge \neg p) \rightarrow q)$
\item $(p \wedge r) \rightarrow \neg q$
\end{enumerate}
\item
\begin{enumerate}
	\item If you have the flu, then you will miss the final exam.

	\item Not missing the final exam is necessary and sufficient for passing the course. OR: You
	will pass the course if and only if you don't miss the final exam
	\item If you miss the final, you will not pass the course.
	\item You have the flu, or you miss the final, or you pass the course.
	\item If you have the flu, then you will not pass the course, or, if you miss the final, you will
	not pass the course.
	\item You have the flu and miss the final exam, or you don't miss the final exam and pass
	the course.

\item A is a knight and B is a knave
\item A is a knave and B is a knight.
\item A is a knight and B is a knight.
\item We don’t know anything about A and B. If A (or B) is a knight, then A (or B) would
truthfully say, “I am a knight”. Likewise, if A (or B) is a knave, they would untruthfully

\item They are not equivalent.
Let $P(x)$ be any propositional function that is sometimes
true and sometimes false, and let $Q(x)$ be any propositional

but $\forall x P(x) \rightarrow \forall x Q(x)$ is true.

\begin{enumerate}
\item 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item For every real number $x$ there exists a real number $y$

	\item For every real number $x$ and real
	number $y$, if $x$ and $y$ are both nonnegative, then their product
	is nonnegative.
	\item or every real number $x$ and real number
	$y$, there exists a real number $z$ such that $xy = z$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item There is some student in your class who has sent a message to
	some student in your class.
	\item There is some student in your

	\item Every student in your class has sent a message to at least
	one student in your class.
	\item Every student in the class
	has sent a message to every student in the class.
\end{enumerate}

\item 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $A(Lois, Prof. Michaels)$
	\item $\forall x (S(x) \rightarrow A(x, Prof. Gross))$
	\item $\forall x (F(x) \rightarrow (A(x, Prof. Miller) \vee A(Prof. Miller, x)))$
	\item $\exists x (S(x) \wedge \forall y (F(y) \rightarrow \neg A(x, y)))$
	\item $\exists x (F(x) \wedge \forall y (S(y) \rightarrow \neg A(y, x)))$
	\item $\forall y (F(y) \rightarrow \exists x (S(x) \vee A(x, y)))$
	\item $\exists x (F(x) \wedge \forall y ((f(y) \wedge (y \ne x)) \rightarrow A(x, y)))$
	\item $\exists x (S(x) \wedge \forall y (F(y) \rightarrow \neg A(y, x)))$
\end{enumerate}
	
\item Suppose that $\forall x P(x) \wedge \exists x Q(x)$ is true. Then $P(x)$ is true for all $x$ and there is an element $y$ for which $Q(y)$ is true.
Because $P(x) \wedge Q(y)$ is true for all $x$ and there is a $y$ for which
$Q(y)$ is true, $\forall x \exists y (P(x) \wedge Q(y))$ is true. Conversely, suppose
that the second proposition is true. Let x be an element
in the domain. There is a $y$ such that $Q(y)$ is true, so $\exists x Q(x)$
is true. Because $\forall x P(x)$ is also true, it follows that the first
proposition is true.
	
\item Suppose that $\forall x P(x) \vee \exists x Q(x)$ is
true. Then either $P(x)$ is true for all $x$, or there exists a $y$ for
which $Q(y)$ is true. In the former case, $P(x) \vee Q(y)$ is true
for all x, so $\forall x \exists y (P(x) \vee Q(y))$ is true. In the latter case,
$Q(y)$ is true for a particular $y$, so $P(x) \vee Q(y)$ is true for all
$x$ and consequently $\forall x \exists y(P(x) \vee Q(y))$ is true. Conversely,
suppose that the second proposition is true. If $P(x)$ is true for
all $x$, then the first proposition is true. If not, $P(x)$ is false for
some $x$, and for this $x$ there must be a $y$ such that $P(x) \vee Q(y)$
is true. Hence, $Q(y)$ must be true, so $\exists y Q(y)$ is true. It follows
that the first proposition must hold.
