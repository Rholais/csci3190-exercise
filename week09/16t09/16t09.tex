	\frametitle{Subset}
	\begin{example}
		Let $S$ be a set of seven positive integers the maximum of which is at most 24. Prove that the sums of the elements in all the nonempty subsets of $S$ cannot be distinct.
	\end{example}
	
	\textbf{Proof.}	Consider all nonempty subsets. Their total sum is at most $18 + 19 + \cdots + 24 = 147$. There are $128 - 1 = 127$ nonempty subsets. There are more holes than pigeons.
	
	\newpage
		
	Consider nonempty subsets of size at most 6. Their total sum is at most $19 + 20 + \cdots + 24 = 129$. There are $127 - 1 = 126$ nonempty subsets of size at most 6 elements. There are still more holes than pigeons.
		
	Consider nonempty subsets of size at most 5. Their total sum is at most $20 + 21 + \cdots + 24 = 110$. There are $126 - 7 = 119$ nonempty subsets with at most 5 elements so at least 2 of them have equal sum.

	\frametitle{Relation}
	\onslide<1->\begin{example}
		Let $n \in \mathbb{Z}^n$, let $U = \{1, 2, \cdots, n\}$. Define the relation $R$ on the power set of $U$ by $(A, B) \in R$ if and only if $A \not\subset B$ and $B \not\subset A$. Is $R$ an equivalence relation? What is $|R|$? (Note that the power set of $U$ is set of all subset of $U$.)
	\end{example}
	\onslide<2>\textbf{Solution} \begin{enumerate}
		\item $R$ is not an equivalence relation. Let $n = 3, A = \{1\}, B = \{2\}$, $C = \{1, 3\}$ so that $(A, B) \in R, (B, C) \in R, (A, C) \notin R$.
		\item $|R| = 2^{2n} - 2(3^n - 2^n)$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
	\frametitle{Equivalence Class}
	\onslide<1->\begin{definition}
		Let $R$ be an equivalence relation on a set $A$. The set of all elements that are related to an element $a$ of $A$ is called the equivalence class of $a$. The equivalence class of a with respect
		to $R$ is denoted by $[a]_R$. When only one relation is under consideration, we can delete the subscript $R$ and write $[a]$ for this equivalence class.
	\end{definition}
	\onslide<2->\begin{example}
		Let $R$ be the relation on the set of integers such that $aRb$ if and only if $a = b$ or $a =-b$. What is the equivalence class of an integer?
	\end{example}
	\onslide<3>\textbf{Solution} Because an integer is equivalent to itself and its negative in this equivalence relation, it follows that $[a]=\{-a, a\}$. This set contains two distinct integers unless $a = 0$. For instance, $[7]=\{-7, 7\}$, $[-5]=\{-5, 5\}$, and $[0]=\{0\}$.
