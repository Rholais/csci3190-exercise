\section{Answer}
\subsection{Basic Structures}
\subsubsection{Sequences and Summations}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Assume $a_n = k$, so that:
\begin{align}
	\frac{(k - 1)k}{2} + 1 \le n & \le \frac{k(k + 1)}{2}\\
	k^2 - k + 2 \le 2n & \le k^2 + k\\
	(k - \frac{1}{2})^2 < (k - \frac{1}{2})^2 + \frac{7}{4} \le 2n & \le (k + \frac{1}{2})^2 - \frac{1}{4} < (k + \frac{1}{2})^2\\
	k - \frac{1}{2} < \sqrt{2n} & < k + \frac{1}{2}\\
	\sqrt{2n} - \frac{1}{2} < k & < \sqrt{2n} + \frac{1}{2}\\
	k & = \lfloor \sqrt{2n} + \frac{1}{2} \rfloor
\end{align}

\item 
\begin{align}
	& \Sigma^n_{j = 1}(a_j - a_{j - 1})\\
	= & \Sigma^n_{j = 1}a_j - \Sigma^n_{j = 1}a_{j - 1}\\
	= & a_n + \Sigma^{n - 1}_{j = 1}a_j - \Sigma^{n - 1}_{j = 1}a_j + a_0\\
	= & a_n - a_0
\end{align}

\item 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item 
	\begin{equation}
		\Sigma^n_{k = 1}(2k - 1) = n^2
	\end{equation}
	
	\item 
	\begin{align}
		& \Sigma^n_{k = 1} k\\
		= & \frac{\Sigma^n_{k = 1}(2k - 1) + \Sigma^n_{k = 1} 1}{2}\\
		= & \frac{n^2 + n}{2}
	\end{align}
\end{enumerate}

\item Since $k^3 - (k - 1)^3 = 3k^2 - 3k + 1$:
\begin{align}
	& \Sigma_{k = 1}^n k^2\\
	= & \frac{n^3 + 3\Sigma_{k = 1}^n k - \Sigma_{k = 1}^n 1}{3}\\
	= & \frac{2n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n - 2n}{6}\\
	= & \frac{2n^3 + 3n^2 + n}{6}
\end{align}
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Cardinality of Sets}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose $m$
new guests arrive at the fully occupied hotel. Move the guest
in Room $n$ to Room $m + n$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, ...$; then the new
guests can occupy rooms 1 to $m$.
\item Move the guest
in Room $n$ to Room $2n$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, ...$.
\item For $n = 1, 2, 3, ...$, put the guest currently in Room $2n$ into Room $n$, and the guest
currently in Room $2n - 1$ into Room $n$ of the new building.
\item Move the guest
in Room $n$ to Room $2n - 1$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, ...$; then the $m$-th new guests can occupy room $2m$.
\item Move the guess currently Room $i$ to Room $2i + 1$ for $i = 1, 2, 3, ...$. Put the $j$ th guest from the $k$-th bus into
Room $2^k(2j + 1)$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Counting}
\subsubsection{The Basics of Counting}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item First of all notice that if we count the number of bit strings containing five consecutive 0's then this number will also be the same as if it ontained five consecutive 1's.
		Containing five consecutive $0$'s: The difficulty with this exercise is that we must beware of double counting things.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item exactly five $0$'s: If the $00000$ start the string, then we will have $000001$, $-$, $-$, $-$, $-$, so $2^4=16$ choices; if the $00000$ are in the middle (not on the end), we have something that looks like $-$, $1000001$,$-$, $-$, so $2^4=16$ choices; if the $00000$ are in the middle (not on the end), we have something that looks like $-$, $1000001$, $-$, $-$,so $2^3=8$ choices, and if the $00000$ is on the end, then the scenario wil look like $-$, $-$, $-$, $-$, $-$,$100000$ and so $16$ choices again. In total $16+8+8+8+8+16=64$ choices.
			\item exactly six $0$'s: Use the same reasoning to get that in this case there are $(8+4+4+4+8)=28$ choices.
			\item exactly seven $0$'s: $4+2+2+4=12$ choices.
			\item exactly eight $0$'s: $2+1+2=5$ choices.
			\item exactly nine $0$'s: $1+1=2$ choices.
			\item exactly ten $0$'s: 1 choice.
		\end{itemize}
		
		In total, for five consecutive $0$'s, there are $64+28+12+5+2+1=112$.
		
		Now for five consecutive $1$'s we also have $112$ such bit string. However, in order to answer our problem, we cannot simply add these two together since we would be double counting two situations $00000111111$ and $1111100000$. Thus the answer to our problem is $112+112-2=222$.

	\item There are $2^n$ values in $n$ variable truth table and each of them can be either $T$ or $F$ so that there are $2^{2^n}$ tables.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{The Pigeonhole Principle}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Proof}. The middle point of $(x_i, y_i)$ and $(x_j, y_j)$ is $(\frac{x_i + x_j}{2}, \frac{y_i + y_j}{2})$. The middle point has integer coordinates if and only if $(x_i, y_i)$ has the same parity of $(x_j, y_j)$.  There are only
	four possibilities for the parity of a pair of integers, namely, (even, even), (even, odd),
	(odd, even), and (odd, odd). For five distinct integers, by Pigeonhole Principle, there
	are at least two points with the same parity. The middle point of these two has integer
	coordinates.
	
	\item \textbf{Proof}. Number the seats around the table
	from 1 to 50, and think of seat 50 as being adjacent to seat 1.
	There are 25 seats with odd numbers and 25 seats with even
	numbers. If no more than 12 boys occupied the odd-numbered seats, then at least 13 boys would occupy the even-numbered
	seats, and vice versa. Without loss of generality, assume that
	at least 13 boys occupy the 25 odd-numbered seats. Then at
	least two of those boys must be in consecutive odd-numbered
	seats, and the person sitting between them will have boys as
	both of his or her neighbors.
	
	\item \textbf{Proof}. Consider a $21 \times 21$ grid. The rows corresponding to the boys and the columns corresponding to the girls. For all$(i, j)$, if the	$i$th boy shares a question $q$ with the $j$th girl	such that there are at least two more girls who solved $q$, then we put a red ball into the	cell $(i, j)$. If $i$th boy shares a question $q$ with the $j$th girl such that there are at least two more boys who solved	$q$, then we put a blue ball into the cell $(i, j)$.  We now claim that each row contains at least 11 red balls and each column contains at least 11 blue balls:

	We will just prove for the rows and the statement about columns follows by a symmetric argument. For any $i$, we will argue that out of the questions that the $i$th	boy	solves, there are at most 5 distinct questions such that for any such question there are at most 2 girls who solved it. This follows by the Pigeonhole principle. Since otherwise the $i$th boy solves more than 6 distinct questions. This set of at most 5 questions, covers only
	$2 \times 5 = 10$ girls with whom boy $i$ shares a question.  This means that with the remaining 11 girls, this boy shares a problem that is solved by at least two other girls. Note that
	whenever it shares such a question with girl $j$, we put a red ball in the cell $(i, j)$. So, there are at least 11 red balls in any row of the grid.
	
	We know that the total number of balls is at least $2 \times 21 \times 11$. This is greater than the total number of cells which is $21 \times 21$. So, by the Pigeonhole principle, there is a cell that contains both blue and red ball. But then this means that the question that is shared in this cell is solved by at least 3 boys and at least 3 girls.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Permutations and Combinations}
\subsubsection{Binomial Coefficients and Identities}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \begin{equation}
	\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n(n - 1)(n - 2) \cdots (n - k + 1)}{k(k - 1)(k - 2) \cdots 2} \le \frac{n \cdot n \cdot \cdots \cdot n}{2 \cdot 2 \cdot \cdots \cdot 2} = \frac{n^k}{2^{k - 1}}
	\end{equation}
	
	\item \begin{enumerate}
		\item We show that each side counts the number of ways
		to choose from a set with n elements a subset with $k$ elements
		and a distinguished element of that set. For the lefthand
		side, first choose the $k$-set (this can be done in $\binom{n}{k}$ ways)
		and then choose one of the $k$ elements in this subset to be
		the distinguished element (this can be done in $k$ ways). For
		the right-hand side, first choose the distinguished element out
		of the entire $n$-set (this can be done in $n$ ways), and then
		choose the remaining $k - 1$ elements of the subset from the
		remaining $n - 1$ elements of the set (this can be done in $\binom{n - 1}{k - 1}$ ways).
		\item \begin{equation}
			k \binom{n}{k} = k \cdot \frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} = \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)!}{(k - 1)!(n - k)!} = n \binom{n - 1}{k - 1}.
